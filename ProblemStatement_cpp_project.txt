Write a menu-driven interactive console based C++ application to perform temperature values 
manipulations. There has to be a provision for conversion of temperature values from one unit to 
other units. 

Add the facility to accept 24 temperature values on one particular day for a city. Repeat this data input 
process of one city, for multiple cities. The city can be a capital city and for such city you have to 
maintain data about the state for which it is capital. For capital city data from multiple locations needs 
to be gathered (you are free to decide any number more than one location, typically 4 locations). 
Additionally, keep the provision to maintain the temperature data values for more than one cities, for 
future use, such that: 

a) Display all cities with city name along with minimum, maximum and average temperature 
values for individual city. 

b) Sort temperature data as per user choice, i.e. either min, max or average temperature of 
all cities,
 
c) search temperature values for a particular city,
 
d) update temperature values for a particular city and 
 
e) delete an unwanted complete record of a particular city. 

Note: The project must involve dynamic polymorphism of some kind.
